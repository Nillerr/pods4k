# Immutable Arrays

Immutable Arrays are a safer and more efficient alternative to read-only lists while maintaining familiar operations.
See [Benefits](#benefits) for a detailed comparison versus regular arrays, read-only lists, and immutable lists.

Unlike regular arrays or read-only lists, immutable arrays cannot be mutated allowing them to be safely shared without
needing immutable collections:

```kotlin
val names = immutableArrayOf("Dan", "Bob")
println(names[0]) // "Dan"

names[1] = "Jane" // Compile error: No set method providing array access

// Unlike read-only lists, casting doesn't introduce a backdoor for mutation:
@Suppress("CAST_NEVER_SUCCEEDS")
(names as Array<String>)[1] = "Jane" // ClassCastException
```

Immutable arrays wrap regular arrays with zero-cost abstractions that get eliminated at compile-time without exposing
mutating capabilities. This results in regular arrays in the generated bytecode along with many optimizations. Dozens of
common operations are highly specialized making immutable arrays even more efficient and performant than regular arrays.

## Dependency

See [dependency instructions](../README.md#dependency).

## Easy to use

Immutable arrays can be used similarly to how we use lists with all the common operations that we would expect:

```kotlin
val people = immutableArrayOf(
    Person(name = "Dan", age = 3),
    Person(name = "Bob", age = 20),
) // ImmutableArray<Person>

println(people) // [Person(name=Dan, age=3), Person(name=Bob, age=20)]

for (person in people) {
    println(person)
}

people
    .filter { it.age >= 18 } // ImmutableArray<Person>
    .forEach { adult -> println(adult.name) }

val ages = people.map { it.age } // efficient ImmutableIntArray storing primitive ints
val (age1, age2) = names // destructuring

// etc.
```

<summary>Creation Examples</summary>

**Empty arrays:**

Creating empty arrays just references 1 of the 9 pre-allocated empty singletons:

```kotlin
emptyImmutableArray<String>()
emptyImmutableBooleanArray()
emptyImmutableFloatArray()
// Similarly for all 8 base types (Int, Double, etc.)
```

**Array of values:**

```kotlin
immutableArrayOf("Bob", "Jane") // ["Bob", "Jane"]

// Providing values of one of the 8 base types will automatically result in an efficient primitive array
immutableArrayOf(1, 2, 3) // [1, 2, 3] primitive int array

// Specifying the generic type forces a generic array, so the 8 base types will be auto-boxed
immutableArrayOf<Int>(1, 2, 3) // [Integer(1), Integer(2), Integer(3)]
```

**Array with generated elements:**

```kotlin
ImmutableArray(size = 3) { index -> index.toString() } // ["0", "1", "2"]

ImmutableIntArray(size = 5) { it * it } // [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

ImmutableBooleanArray(size = 3) { it % 2 == 0 } // [true, false, true]
```

**Creating from regular arrays:**

```kotlin
val regularArray = arrayOf("Bob", "Jane")
regularArray.toImmutableArray()

// Creating from arrays of auto-boxed values will maintain the same type keeping those wrapper objects:
val autoBoxedBooleans = arrayOf(true, false, true) // [Boolean(true), Boolean(false), Boolean(true)]
autoBoxedBooleans.toImmutableArray() // [Boolean(true), Boolean(false), Boolean(true)]

// However, you can choose the more efficient primitive array type instead:
autoBoxedBooleans.toImmutableBooleanArray() // [true, false, true]
```

**Creating from collections:**

```kotlin
val list = listOf(1, 2, 3)

// Creating from collections of auto-boxed values will maintain the same type keeping those wrapper objects:
list.toImmutableArray() // [Integer(1), Integer(2), Integer(3)]

// However, you can choose the more efficient primitive array type instead:
list.toImmutableIntArray() // [1, 2, 3] primitive int array
```

## Memory Layout

Performing some operation that results in an `ImmutableIntArray` ends up with the following memory layout:

![Memory Layout of immutable arrays](src/main/resources/immutable-array-memory-layout.drawio.png)

Note that the `values` variable of type `ImmutableIntArray` actually references a regular primitive int array.

Here is the same example but operating on a regular primitive array and ending up with a read-only list:

![Memory Layout of Read-only Lists](src/main/resources/list-memory-layout.drawio.png)

Classes that operate on generics, such as lists, can't store primitive types directly. Each 32-bit integer gets
auto-boxed into an `Integer` wrapper object and a pointer to that wrapper is passed to the resulting list. The garbage
collector periodically moves surviving objects around, so we can end up with the objects scattered throughout the heap.

<details>
<summary>Memory Impacts</summary>

1. Notice that the list contains 7 values but the backing array has a size of 10 with 3 null elements.  `ArrayList`
   starts with a default capacity of 10. As elements pass the filter criteria and get added to the array, if the backing
   array becomes full, a new array that's 1.5 times larger is created and the elements are copied over. On average,
   array lists end up with about 17% of unused capacity when the exact resulting size isn't known ahead of time.

2. Although a 32-bit integer needs just 4 bytes to represent the value, in a typical 64-bit JVM environment,
   an `Integer` wrapper object requires 16 bytes for the object header, 4 bytes for the actual integer value, plus
   another 4 bytes of padding totalling 24 bytes. If we enable pointer compression, we can reduce this down to 16 bytes
   per wrapper.

3. In addition to the size of the `Integer` wrapper objects, the backing array stores pointers to the memory address of
   each of these wrappers. So ignoring the memory overhead of the list object and ignoring the unused over-provisioned
   spots, we need 32 bytes to store each 4-byte integer value!  With pointer compression, we can reduce this down to 20
   bytes for each 4-byte integer but that's still a 5X increase in memory!

</details>

<details>
<summary>Performance Impacts</summary>

When performing a trivial operation like `readOnlyList.get(index) + 1`, the following steps are performed behind the
scenes (note that this is a simplified explanation of the main steps):

1. Fetch the memory at the address specified by the `readOnlyList` variable to load the ArrayList object.
2. Ensure that `index` is smaller than the list size (enforced by the ArrayList class).
3. Fetch the memory at the address specified by the `elementData` variable from the `ArrayList` class to load the
   backing array object.
4. Ensure that `index` is smaller than the array size. This second check is enforced by the JVM for array accesses.
5. Compute the array address of that element into the array (ie. `offset + elementSize * index`)
6. Fetch the memory at that computed location into the array, interpreting it as a pointer, and return that pointer
   back up the chain to the caller of `readOnlyList.get(index)`.
7. Fetch the memory specified by that pointer to get the `Integer` wrapper object.
8. Cast the object to an `Integer` by validating the object header (since generics are erased at compile time).
9. Unbox the `Integer` object into a primitive `int` and finally add 1.

Notice how many steps and memory hops are performed to fetch a single value! Iterating through read-only lists in tight
loops and performing operations on primitive values performs very poorly on modern CPU architectures. That's because
these values are scattered throughout memory resulting in very poor cache locality.

Fetching data from main memory can take several hundred cycles on modern CPU architectures. The CPU tries to minimize
this latency by predicting addresses that will be fetched and pre-fetches data from those locations before they're
actually requested. When these guesses are incorrect, that pre-fetched data is ignored and the values need to be loaded
from the correct address in main memory. Iterating through a primitive array is a best-case scenario as the CPU will
fetch the initial element along with neighboring elements so that subsequent elements are already loaded by the time we
request them. However, the CPU pre-fetcher has a tough time predicting the address of scattered data so this can have a
large impact on performance.

To get an idea of the potential performance impact of wrapper objects, Java Language Architect, Brian Goetz, ran some
benchmarks replacing reference carriers with values as part of project Valhalla exploration. Brian found performance
improvements ranging from 3.5x to 12x faster: [YouTube presentation](https://youtu.be/1H4vmT-Va4o?t=899)

## Benefits

### Benefits over regular arrays

<details>
<summary>Meaningful toString()</summary>

Unlike regular arrays, calling toString() on immutable arrays produces a pretty representation of the data:

```kotlin
println(immutableArrayOf("Dan", "Bob")) // [Dan, Bob]  Nice!
println(arrayOf("Dan", "Bob")) // [Ljava.lang.String;@7d4991ad  Yuck!
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Efficient sharing of encapsulated data</summary>

Regular arrays can have their elements reassigned making them a poor choice for encapsulated data that's occasionally
shared. Using an array forces us to duplicate the contents into a collection before sharing so that callers can't
mutate the encapsulated array. This negatively affects performance and adds extra pressure on the garbage collector.
Immutable arrays can be safely shared resulting in cleaner and more efficient code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Efficient operations</summary>

Regular arrays are usually chosen for memory or performance reasons, however these benefits are negated when performing
dozens of typical operations:

```kotlin
val weights = doubleArrayOf(1.5, 3.0, 10.2, 15.7, 2.0)
val interestingWeights = weights.filter { it > 10.0 }
// Oops, all our effort is in vain as this results in a 
// List<Double> auto-boxing each resulting value!
```

Unlike regular arrays, all operations on immutable arrays produce the most efficient type so that clean code is
efficient by default:

```kotlin
val people = immutableArrayOf(
    Person(name = "Dan", age = 3),
    Person(name = "Bob", age = 4),
) // ImmutableArray<Person>

// Mapping the ages automatically uses an efficient ImmutableIntArray[3, 4] storing primitive int values
val ages = people.map { it.age }
performStatisticalAnalysis(ages)
```

Here's a non-exhaustive list of operations that benefit from this significant efficiency improvement (some of these will
be added in future releases):

* map
* mapNotNull
* mapIndexed
* flatMap
* flatMapIndexed
* filter
* filterIndexed
* filterNot
* filterNotNull
* take
* takeWhile
* takeLast
* takeLastWhile
* drop
* dropWhile
* dropLast
* dropLastWhile
* reversed
* sorted
* sortedWith
* sortedBy
* sortedDescending
* sortedByDescending
* partition
* slice
* distinct
* distinctBy
* etc.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Avoids equality & hashCode defects</summary>

Unlike regular arrays, Immutable arrays have a proper equals & hashCode implementation allowing us to compare them in
the same way that we compare lists:

```kotlin
// Yes, this condition will be true when the immutable arrays have identical contents
if (immutableArrayOf(1, 2) == immutableArrayOf(1, 2)) return
```

Since we can compare 2 lists directly, developers occasionally attempt to do the same with regular arrays. Even worse,
defects can sneak in without obvious usages of these broken behaviors:

```kotlin
data class Order(val id: Long, private val products: Array<Product>)

val rejectedOrders = mutableSetOf<Order>()
// Oops, attempting to add Orders to a hashSet will make use of the auto-generated 
// equals & hashCode methods from the Order data class which will in turn rely on 
// the defective equals & hashCode implementation of regular arrays
```

</details>

### Benefits over read-only lists

<details>
<summary>Casting doesn't introduce backdoor for mutation</summary>

Read-only lists appear to be immutable at first as they don't expose any mutating methods. However, they can be cast
into a `MutableList` and modified:

```kotlin
val values = listOf(1, 2, 3)
values[0] = 2 // Compiler error: No set method providing array access

(values as MutableList)[0] = 100
println(values) // [100, 2, 3]
```

Immutable arrays don't have this backdoor:

```kotlin
val values = immutableArrayOf(1, 2, 3)
values[0] = 2 // Compiler error: No set method providing array access

@Suppress("CAST_NEVER_SUCCEEDS")
(values as IntArray)[0] = 100
// ClassCastException: ImmutableIntArray cannot be cast to [I
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>More memory efficient</summary>

Read-only lists containing one of the eight base types, like `List<Int>`, use between 5 to 8 times more memory than
immutable arrays! See the **Memory Impacts** section in [Memory Layout](#memory-layout) for details.

Even when storing generic types, read-only lists still use more memory as their backing array usually has about 17% of
unused capacity. There's also the small memory overhead of the `ArrayList` object whereas variables of immutable array
types point directly at the backing array.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Higher performance</summary>

Executing tight loops on read-only lists containing one of the eight base types, like `List<Int>`, can be over 10 times
slower than immutable arrays. See the `Performance Impacts` section in [Memory Layout](#memory-layout) for details.

Even when operating on generic types, read-only lists have an extra layer of indirection since method calls such as
getting an element, are routed through the `ArrayList` class whereas getting an element from an immutable arrays
accesses the array elements directly.

</details>

### Benefits over Guava immutable lists

<details>
<summary>No mutation exceptions at runtime</summary>

Guava immutable lists implement the Java `List` interface and expose mutating methods which throw exceptions at runtime
when attempted to be mutated. Although this prevents mutation, it can result in exceptions being thrown during runtime
affecting the user experience.

Attempting to mutate an immutable array won't even compile catching these types of defects much sooner.

</details>

<details>
<summary>More memory efficient</summary>

When creating Guava immutable lists by copying an existing list, they have the same memory drawbacks as read-only lists
(see [Benefits over read-only lists](#benefits-over-read-only-lists)) but twice as bad since we have 2 lists.

When creating a Guava immutable list by wrapping an existing list, it pretty much has the same memory drawbacks as
read-only lists since the extra wrapper is tiny.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Higher performance</summary>

When exposing an encapsulated list by copying it into a Guava immutable list, this has the same performance drawbacks
as read-only lists (see [Benefits over read-only lists](#benefits-over-read-only-lists)) plus the added overhead of
copying the elements.

When wrapping an existing list in a Guava immutable list, we get the same performance drawbacks as read-only lists , but
slightly worse as this introduces another layer of indirection due to the additional wrapper object.

</details>

## Caveats

<details>
<summary>Shallow immutability</summary>

Similar to Guava immutable lists, immutable arrays only prevent mutation of the array so that elements cannot be added,
removed, or replaced. However, the elements themselves can still be mutated if they expose mutating capabilities:

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, var spouse: Person? = null)

val people = immutableArrayOf(
    Person("Bob"),
    Person("Jane"),
)

// The `people` immutable array is protected against mutation
people[0] = Person("Dan") // Compile error: No set method providing array access

// However, a `Person` instance can be mutated since it exposes `spouse` as a var property 
people[0].spouse = Person("Jill")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Auto-boxing</summary>

Immutable arrays are zero-cost abstractions that get eliminated at compile time. All variables, properties, function
arguments, function receiver types, or return types that explicitly use the immutable array types get replaced
at compile time to operate directly on the underlying array without any auto-boxing or wrapper object.

In order to avoid representing its identity as the identity of the underlying array, the Kotlin compiler adds additional
instructions everywhere the immutable array is interpreted as a generic type, or by a supertype like `Any` or `Any?`. In
these scenarios, the immutable array is auto-boxed into a single tiny wrapper object which stores a reference to the
actual array and that wrapper object is passed along. However, generic functions that are marked with the `inline`
modifier, such as `with` from the Kotlin standard library, don't induce auto-boxing because the function is inlined into
each call site replacing the generic with the actual type.

Note that using reflection to traverse the object graph, reflective code will encounter the underlying array directly
without any wrapper except for the auto-boxing scenarios in which case it will encounter the wrapper that contains the
underlying array.

Here are some examples to get a better idea of where auto-boxing occurs:

```kotlin
// no auto-boxing.  `names` references the underlying array directly
val names = immutableArrayOf("Dan", "Bob")

// no auto-boxing because `with` is an inline function so the generic parameter disappears at compile time
with(names) {
    println(this.size)
}

// casting induces auto-boxing.  This prevents any backdoor to the underlying array 
names as Any

// auto-boxing since println accepts a variable of type Any
println(names)

// Even though we're explicitly specifying the ImmutableArray type as the generic type, remember that the ArrayList 
// class itself isn't hardcoded to work with immutable arrays
val arrays = ArrayList<ImmutableArray<String>>()
arrays += names // auto-boxing due to generics

// auto-boxing due to generic receiver
names.genericExtensionFunction()

fun <T> T.genericExtensionFunction() {
    ...
}
```

The overhead of auto-boxing the entire array is identical to that of autoboxing a single primitive `Double` value. Since
this is referring to the entire immutable array, the memory or performance overhead of this operation is negligible in
most scenarios. Normally auto-boxing can have a large memory or performance impact when auto-boxing many values like
what happens with read-only lists. However, in this case the immutable array itself is auto-boxed into a single tiny
wrapper without auto-boxing any of the array elements.

For optimal performance, we recommend using the immutable array types for everything that expects to work with immutable
arrays as this avoids auto-boxing. Generic types on inline functions also avoid auto-boxing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>No identity</summary>

Immutable arrays are zero-cost abstractions that get eliminated at compile time. In a way, we can think of them as a
kind of virtual quantum particle that doesn't actually exist except sometimes (see Auto-boxing above).

Since immutable arrays aren't real wrapper objects, attempting to use their identities is not supported. Here are some
patterns that attempt to make use of their identities:

Reference equality:

```kotlin
fun replaceArray(replacement: ImmutableArray<String>) {
    if (currentValues === replacement) { // Compiler error: Identity equality is forbidden
        // Note the reference equality.  Regular structural equality using `==` is allowed and works as expected
    }
    currentValues = replacement
}
```

Identity hashCode:

```kotlin
val values = immutableArrayOf(1, 2, 3)
val identityHashCode = System.identityHashCode(values)
// Oops, the identityHashCode function accepts any type instead of an immutable array type, so it's auto-boxed into a 
// tiny wrapper object and the identity hashCode of that temporary wrapper is returned
```

Synchronization:

```kotlin
class Account(val accountHolders: ReadOnlyArray<Person>) {
    private var balance: Money = 0.dollars

    fun withdraw(amount: Money) {
        // Compiler warning: Synchronizing by ImmutableArray<Person> is forbidden
        synchronized(accountHolders) {
            // Oops, the synchronized function accepts any type instead of an immutable array type, so it's auto-boxed 
            // into a new temporary tiny wrapper object, and we're meaninglessly synchronizing on that temporary wrapper
            balance -= amount
        }
    }
}
```

</details>
