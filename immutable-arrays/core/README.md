# Immutable Arrays - Core

The core Immutable-Arrays library. This includes:

* The core `ImmutableArray` class storing generic values
* 8 specializations for the 8 primitive types (eg. `ImmutableIntArray`, `ImmutableBooleanArray`, etc.)
* Most of the common operations that we would expect (eg. `map`, `filter`, etc.)
* Extensions on standard library types so that using immutable arrays in your code is as natural as using lists while
  maintaining efficiency.
