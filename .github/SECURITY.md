# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We focus development efforts on the latest release of the library to reduce maintenance overhead and increase the pace of improvement.  We'll prioritize releasing a new version of the library whenever any security concerns are addressed but we don't plan on back-porting fixes to earlier releases.

We recommend staying up to date with the latest version of this library as that will provide the most secure and best experience.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please create a [Bug Report](https://github.com/daniel-rusu/pods4k/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) documenting the security vulnerability clearly along with examples of how to encounter it.
